    // thing to re-read*.

    // | product | evidence |
    // | --- | --- |
    // | codex | documented: `learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills` |

    // | opencode | vendor lists *Global agent-compatible: `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`*; the binary carries the literal |
    // | pi | source, and no page says it: `package-manager.js:2017` |
    //
    // The same sweep found a second shared surface, in the other direction:
    // `~/.claude/skills` is read by grok (*User tier, Lowest, configurable*) and
    // opencode (*Global Claude-compatible*) as well as by Claude Code. This
    // provider's neighbour owns it, and a namespace is removed whole -- so a
    // remove of the Claude setup changes what two other products see.
    //
    // Pi's is the one worth keeping the method for. Its pinned `0.84.3` bundle,
    // `package/dist/core/package-manager.js`: line 1976 builds
    // `userAgentsSkillsDir = join(getHomeDir(), ".agents", "skills")`, line 2012
    // names the root itself as its `dirname`, and line 2017 loads from it --
    // `addResources("skills", collectAutoSkillEntries(userAgentsSkillsDir,
    // "agents"), ...)`. No Pi page says so. (A neighbouring use in
    // `trust-manager.js:160` *excludes* that directory while walking up for a
    // project-scoped one, so the variable name alone would have misread it; the
    // line that matters is 2017.)
    //
    // **Both sentences that used to close this block have since expired**, and
    // they are kept here as the shape rather than deleted, because a reason
    // nobody re-reads is how a correct record goes quietly wrong.
    //
    // It said *nothing routes to `user_root` yet*. The consumer routes this
    // provider's `skill` there today: `composition.py`,
    // `Rule("skill", "skills", "directory", "codex", target_scope="user_root")`.
    //
    // It said the other four were *deliberately not given the same scoped

    // each with its own state file. Verified with the shipped binaries.
